this sidewalk appears to continue under this eroded hillside and starts again on the other side this land is owned by a developer that has been trying for years to build residences further back in the lot and have the driveway connect to ross street at this spot the hillside has completely covered the sidewalk over time vegetation has grown in making it impassible pedestrians are forced to walk in the street or cross where there is no crosswalk and where they are often forced to do so between parked cars this has created a hazard that needs to be corrected by cutting the hillside back and removing vegetation in the short term and installing a retaining wall in the long term,Sidewalks,Sidewalks,0.179,1

smart train crossing signals not coordinated with traffic lights traffic lights not optimally timed many times traffic on 2nd street and 3rd street is unnecessarily backed up due to the fact that the timing of the train crossing signal and the traffic lights do not appear to be coordinated the train will pass by and the gates will lift but the traffic light will remain red when the lights turn from red to green on 2nd or 3rd they seem to do so from front to back instead of back to front so for example for a car traveling west on 3rd st stopped at hetherton st the light at hetherton will turn green but the lights at the bus station and at tamalpais etc are still red and the cars are backed up so that no movement is possible until those lights turn if those lights turned green first that would allow those cars to clear out such that when the light at hetherton turned green there would be room to move and traffic would flow more smoothly,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.981,1

vmail rec d 3 25 2024 hi today s monday morning i have a suggestion on 4th st as you re driving downtown san rafael eastbound towards the 101 overpass if you notice driving at all of the plus sign intersections 4th and c 4th and b 4th and b if you re going eastbound none of the intersections have a no u turn sign posted next to the traffic light i spoke with the centerfield police officer this morning at the headquarters the officer said it is against the law to make a u turn at or by any double yellow line and no passing sign and the double yellow line no passing means no u turns but there s no u turn sign posted by the traffic light again this is eastbound 4th street downtown center fell bcd streets none of them had that sign now it may be expensive or maybe we re just assuming that the drivers realize that it s illegal but i ve seen several cars make illegal u turns at 4th and c and b b and i m not a police officer but if the sign is posted then at least there will be warned not to do that because the sanford police says it s illegal i know in san anselmo they already have signs posted the senate summer ave by the coffee roastery that say no u turns and there s a 271 fine if you re caught doing it so just a suggestion i m in fairfax even an idea to post some no u turn signs at the force at least eastbound possibly westbound too i guess it s bc and b streets if that s possible if that s appropriate thank you,Suggested Improvement/Change,Street Sign and Markings,0.476,0

i previously sent a concern which you received and responded to see below request 20104531 i neglected to mention some other concerns at 4 miramar ave as cars bare right coming up resevoir on to miramar ave it is a one lane road this makes it more dangerous not just for cars and bicyclists traveling in the opposite direction around the bend from the upper part of miramar ave but also for the many pedestrians who walk the neighborhood for exercise and walk their dogs again my concern is for cars going faster that the 15 mph warning sign who are going uphill on reservoir and then bearing right on to miramar they may not see ongoing pedestrians as well as cars or bicyclists until it s too late to avoid them the reverse is also true but i think to a lesser extent as pedestrians cars and bicyclist might not see speeding cars going up miramar ave as i said last time i have seen bicyclists wipe as they go south around the curve on miramar fortunately no cars were coming in the opposite direction at the time if speed bumps aren t an option as you explained i would very much appreciate some other suggestions to make this area safer i m concerned that this area around 4 miramar could result in an accident that we would be tragic especially if it could be avoided thank you traffic traffic signal tránsito señal reported at 4 miramar ave san rafael california 94901 this request s status is acknowledged 9 29 25 3 54 25 pm as cars go up reservoir road and then stay right to go onto miramar ave they often go very fast it is uphill north and be the time they get to where it flattens out it can be too late for them to see ongoing vehicles or bicyclists i ve witnessed cars pick up trucks going much faster than the 15mph sign going up miramar where again fortunately no cars or bicyclist were in the street coming in the opposite direction on the other hand cars and bicyclists going south on miramar ave are going around a bend and if a car particularly one going fast is coming toward them it can be hard for them to see the car and stop in time this becomes more of a problem for bicyclist or cars going fast around the bend i ve witnessed bicyclists wipe out going around the bend and fortunately there were no cars going in the opposite direction i think someone from public works should investigate this area for a possible speed bump or speed bumps your responded was speed humps are designed for vehicle to drive over them comfortably at 25 mph so it won t help the situation you described additionally speed humps slow fire apparatus and will impact the emergency services response time city fd is opposed to installing speed humps on most areas we will check the site and possibly look at installing curve warning signs to warn motorists and bicyclists ahead of the road curve i wanted to add the following concern which i neglected to mention before,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.595,1

the manhole cover in the street in front of 292 knight drive in san rafael looks like it was first popped up by the heavy machinery that has been working on this street daily since july or so then this manhole cover had been broken into two or more pieces likely by the same type of machinery it was then covered with sand and has two orange cones on each side this sits right in the middle of our narrow street which means that cars must drive around which is potentially dangerous this should be fixed as soon as possible also you ll notice that the house at 292 knight drive has two large piles of stones against the curb and extending well into the street with orange cones around the piles these piles of stones have been there for at least 4 months the homeowner seems to be totally disregarding the fact that these piles of stones make cars have to veer away from the piles coming up the street the situation is made considerably worse by the broken manhole cover that is only a few feet away from those piles again this combination is creating a dangerous obstruction in the middle of upper knight drive,Pothole/Road Condition,Pothole/Road Condition,0.333,1

dear pw the homelessness crisis is sad and very real i don t lack empathy for unhoused people but the bike paths and bike lanes are becoming incredibly unsafe with physical obstructions like chairs glass bottles and trash yesterday there was a swivel chair that rolled out into the bike lane on anderson at a causing bikes to swerve into the car traffic lanes and the obstructions in the bike path that connects francisco to anderson are very dangerous in terms of crashing into them i m not complaining about the people themselves they have no where to go but the city of san rafael needs to get an handle on the situation and start cleaning up the rights of way and perhaps sending crisis counselors in a regular basis instead of using multi use paths and bike lanes as storage for homeless people so that people who don t care about either homelessness or car less transportation can turn a blind eye to the situation thank you,Sidewalks,Illegal Dumping,0.205,0

re conversion of one way to two way streets in san rafael d street suggestion for improvement describes conditions where the entry to o reilly automotive parking lot yellow line on attached image is blocked by a vehicle waiting to make a right hand turn i have seen vehicles red line moving along 2nd street preparing to enter o reilly s parking lot but cannot proceed because the way is blocked resulting in d street traffic headed south toward wolf grade also being blocked this effectively blocks all traffic moving across 2nd st green line note that during rush hour there is or can be a long line of vehicles queued up for this turn onto 2nd feel free to project your own experience when you have been in this situation to get a sense of others reaction to it it is true that this condition existed prior to the change from one to two way but the distinction is that now there is more traffic moving across 2nd that can t proceed because the way is blocked whereas before it was not as popular a route to take and while inconvenient it was also infrequent the duration and consequence of the blockage is difficult to model and impossible to describe as it might occur under various traffic loads for example morning rush hour or late night usage so i will not try the importance of d st is that it is used by emergency services specifically the fire department to gain access to gerstel park therefore any delay whether a momentary or full red light cycle is an unnecessary additional danger to human safety serendipitously the screen grab image shows a version of this about to occur but for a different reason then presented above one suggestion would be to add a do not block keep clear or similar instruction in front of the entry to o reilly,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.437,1

regarding manuel t freitas parkway from monticello rd to lea drive and from arlene terrace or iris lane or even sylvia way past lea dr and through to montecillo rd over the years there have been multiple collisions between bicycles and vehicles at freitas pkwy and lea dr there have been at least two fatalities that i know one in 2019 or 2020 and one last saturday 6 28 25 bikers fly down from the open space at the top of frietas past arlene terrace iris lane sylvia way and lea drive often through the four way stop at montecillo i have lived at the meadows of terra linda for almost 20 years so i ve seen this many times and even as a cautious driver i have had near collisions myself due to poor visibility and reckless bike riders while turning left onto lea drive from freitas parkway everyone understands that bikers have the right of way however that is irrelevant if a driver cannot see them due to vegetation or bikers high speeds and dark clothing it is time to prevent further accidents and loss of life my 1st request is for the vegetation that obscures this intersection to be removed entirely not just pruned on an irregular basis this includes the pine tree and bushes my 2nd request is for speed bumps to be placed across frietas from the top of the hill to the bottom near montecillo to slow speeding vehicles and bikers preventing reckless joy rides additionally speed bumps are necessary from montecillo rd leading up to the left turn at lea drive so cars will have to slow down and be able to carefully assess this intersection for pedestrians crossing lea dr or bikes and cars racing down the hill on frietas prior to turning the uploaded image shows the view looking up frietas at the turn onto lea even if a driver is turning slowly and trying to look for bicyclists it could be impossible to see them especially when bikes are traveling at high speeds cars are can also be difficult to see a driver might have their eyes focused to the left looking for pedestrians and completely miss a bike that might then collide with them it is critical for the city to address this as soon as possible everyone in the community can deal with speeds bumps and the loss of the bushes and tree to prevent lives from being lost over and over again i urge the city to take action,Other (Unlisted Request for Public Works),Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.447,0

i think the traffic signals at this intersection as well as the intersections of hetherton with 5th 4th 3rd and 2nd streets should not allow a right turn to be made on a red light due to the lights added for smart traffic headed west bound on mission 5th etc is often backed up through the railroad crossing lights between 101 and lincoln when this happens there is often room for just a very few westbound cars to cross hetherton on the westbound green light while a westbound driver waits for a space to open up before crossing hetherton for example on mission very often the 101 drivers turn right on red making it difficult for the westbound traffic to advance or to clear the intersection before the hetherton lights turn green thus the westbound cars could inadvertently block the intersection,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.887,1

email rec d from local business re illegal dumping dear public works team i m writing on behalf of sol food regarding an issue that has persisted for many years the recurring accumulation of trash on the lincoln avenue sidewalk between 3rd and 4th streets specifically in front of the private parking lot just a stone s throw from our restaurant we ve informally dubbed this area the trash vortex due to the volume and variety of debris it routinely collects to highlight the issue we ve compiled photos from over the years on this instagram page feel free to follow and share we understand this stretch of sidewalk falls under the oversight of multiple city agencies which has made coordinated solutions difficult that said a potential fix was discussed during a previous site visit or brainstorming session but unfortunately was never implemented we respectfully ask the city to consider taking the following steps 1 notify the businesses using this section of sidewalk for garbage service that going forward bins must be placed on 4th street instead 2 install a planter or other permanent obstruction along the fence line of the private parking lot to physically deter trash placement in this area we believe these two simple steps could significantly reduce illegal dumping and improve the streetscape for all nearby businesses and residents after nearly a decade of informal maintenance and cleanup efforts on our part we are sincerely asking for the city s support to help close this chapter thank you for your attention and consideration,Illegal Dumping,Illegal Dumping,0.56,1

lane striping and curb paint on mission on both sides of lincoln reflects the pre smart conditions given the constrictions smart has cause by reducing the mission crossing to one lane a parking lane on mission west of the crossing to lincoln should be created to alleviate confusion about a second lane there alternatively the turning land for southbound lincoln could be expanded this block between tamalpais and lincoln currently has red on the whole south side which makes for a enough room for cars to form two lines west of lincoln on mission should be restriped to more effectively use the turning lane north onto lincoln lincoln has become the easiest route to get north out of downtown because of the train mess the turning lane should be expanded up to nye and the adjacent striping curb paint adjusted accordingly mission is backed up for blocks and blocks every evening because smart changed the traffic flow and these changes to the approach to the tracks would eliminate confusion and help traffic flow,Street Sign and Markings,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.599,0

i am writing to urgently request the installation of a sign near this driveway to warn pedestrians bicyclists electric scooters and drivers of the presence of trucks entering and exiting these premises since the update of this street the driveway now has a semi blind corner since traffic must only take a right turn instead of being able to take a left like several years ago the speed that these electric scooters and bicycles are doing sometimes it is very easy to miss them coming from 2nd street i m not sure if a stop sign would be required but definitely some caution or warning would indeed help keep everyone aware recently there have been several close calls involving trucks pulling out and it s becoming increasingly apparent that without proper signage there s a heightened risk of accidents occurring i am genuinely concerned that if action isn t taken promptly it s only a matter of time before a serious incident transpires the safety of everyone in our community including pedestrians cyclists and other motorists is paramount by installing a clearly visible sign indicating truck traffic we can significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents and ensure that everyone remains safe i kindly urge you to consider this request your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated and i sincerely hope that by taking proactive measures we can prevent any potential accidents or injuries thank you for your understanding and cooperation,Suggested Improvement/Change,Street Sign and Markings,0.344,0

dear public works department as a concerned resident i wanted to reach out regarding a safety issue on the long stretch of road between the san rafael shoreline and the canal street apartment building at 35 canal street this portion of the road especially in front of the newly renovated basketball courts lacks stop signs crosswalks or speed bumps and has a slight blind spot unfortunately this makes it a popular spot for speeding and even racing i witness this behavior daily and it puts children families and pets at serious risk many of whom try to cross the street in that area given the layout and ongoing safety concerns i believe installing a speed bump would be the most effective solution it would force drivers to slow down and make the area safer for everyone especially young children who use the courts and nearby facilities thank you for taking the time to read my message i truly hope the city can consider making this stretch of road safer for the community sincerely,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,Traffic/ Traffic Signal,0.267,1
